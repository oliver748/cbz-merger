# CBZ Merger
A quick and easy way to merge a bunch of your manga/manhwa/comics (both .cbz and .cbr works) into just one .cbz or .cbr file â€” this can be used if you don't want to switch cbz/cbr file all the time.

Future implementations will be made - like being able to remove certain pages which can create a better flow when reading.
